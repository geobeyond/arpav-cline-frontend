                It is directly accessible to citizens, free of charge and without
                credentials, and provides projections on the future state of the climate
                in the territory of North-East Italy. It offers, in particular, the
                visualization of maps and time series of climate projections for
                specific points, with reference to various climate indicators, with the
                possibility of comparing these with historical series measured by the
                stations of the regional weather-hydro-snow network.
