          Measured temperature in Veneto and projections for the future. Where

        The barometer uses the annual average temperature as an indicator of
        ongoing and expected climate change. In the chart:
        <ul>
          <li>
            the temperature recorded in Veneto over recent decades (black line);
          </li>
          <li>
            climate projections until the end of the century for three different
            greenhouse gas emission reduction scenarios (blue, yellow, and red
            lines).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </>
