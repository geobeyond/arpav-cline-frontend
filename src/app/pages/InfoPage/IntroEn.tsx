                <h1>Climate change</h1>
                <p>
                    Human activities affect the climate: the increase in greenhouse gas
                    concentration and the consequent observed changes in long-term average
                    climate values and climate extremes in every part of the world are
                    clear signals of this. In the Mediterranean area, in particular, the
                    conditions that alter the climate balance are more severe, such as
                    rising temperatures and decreasing summer precipitation, and its
                    increased vulnerability compared to other regions, leading to more
                    serious climate risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An assessment of climate change and its variability at a regional
                    scale therefore becomes crucial to estimate its potential impacts in
                    the future, for the development of adaptation strategies (process of
                    adjustment to current or expected climate and its effects, in order to
                    limit harm or exploit beneficial opportunities) and to evaluate
                    mitigation actions (any human intervention that reduces emissions or
                    strengthens greenhouse gas absorption sources).

                    The <strong>Cli</strong>mate <strong>N</strong>orth-
                    <strong>E</strong>ast (CliNE) Platform offers
                    <strong>climate projections</strong> for the territory of
                    <strong>North-East Italy</strong> through
                    <strong>thirteen indicators</strong> calculated for possible
                    <strong>future climate scenarios</strong> and adapted to data
                    collected from regional meteorological stations.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    These projections are provided in terms of maps and time series, for
                    different time horizons and three emission scenarios, with the
                    possibility of extraction and download of data for specific points of
                    interest. Furthermore, it is possible to view and compare the annual
                    point series provided by the projection with the historical point
                    series measured by the measurement stations of the regional
                    weather-hydro-snow network present in the immediate vicinity (within 1
                    km).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The information presented in the Platform is useful for policy makers,
                    stakeholders and citizens, in order to support territorial planning,
                    adaptation measures to climate change and, more generally, increase
                    knowledge and awareness about ongoing climate change.
