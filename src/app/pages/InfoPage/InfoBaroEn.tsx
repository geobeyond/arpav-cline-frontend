                <p>
                    The climate barometer, similar to the barometer that measures
                    atmospheric pressure used to describe and predict meteorological
                    evolution, is intended to be a simple and direct tool to describe and
                    predict the changing climate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this context, the average annual temperature measured by regional
                    weather stations tells the story of climate evolution in Veneto up to
                    the present day. Climate projections represent possible future
                    climates, each of which starts from the current situation while
                    considering socio-economic, demographic, and technological
                    developments that lead to different greenhouse gas emission scenarios,
                    the main cause of global warming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The comparison between the measured average annual temperature and
                    climate projections offers a measure of the changing climate and its
                    possible future evolution.
